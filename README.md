## 📂 Dataset Details
- **Source:** Contains essential **soil parameters** and **crop types**.
- **Features:** Includes soil properties such as **pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and crop labels**.
- **Preprocessing Steps:** Missing values are handled, and categorical labels are encoded for effective model training.

## 📊 Data Analysis
🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Distribution of Soil Properties:** Histograms and boxplots are used to understand the spread and skewness of features like pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
- **Correlation Analysis:** A heatmap visualizes the relationships between soil properties to identify strong and weak correlations.
- **Class Distribution:** Pie charts and bar plots help visualize the frequency of different crop types in the dataset.

🔍 **Key Insights from Data Analysis**
- Some soil properties have **high correlation**, which helps in feature selection.
- Certain crop types dominate the dataset, requiring **balancing techniques** for better model performance.
- Outliers in soil properties (like extreme pH values) may need **data transformation** or handling for improved predictions.

## 🏆 Model Results
| Model | Accuracy | F1 Score |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| 🌲 Random Forest | **92.3%** | **0.91** |
| 🔥 Gradient Boosting | **89.7%** | **0.88** |
| 🤖 Voting Classifier | **91.5%** | **0.90** |
| 🧮 Logistic Regression | **85.2%** | **0.83** |

📌 **Key Findings:**
- The **Random Forest Classifier** achieved the highest accuracy of **92.3%**, making it the best model for crop prediction.
- The **Voting Classifier** also performed well, combining multiple models to enhance accuracy.
- **Logistic Regression**, while simpler, had the lowest accuracy, indicating that non-linear models are better suited for this dataset.
