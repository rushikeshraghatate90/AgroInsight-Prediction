## 🐂 Dataset Details
- **Source:** Contains essential **soil parameters** and **crop types**.
- **Features:** Includes soil properties such as **pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and crop labels**.
- **Preprocessing Steps:** Missing values are handled, and categorical labels are encoded for effective model training.

---

## 📊 Data Analysis
🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Distribution of Soil Properties:** Histograms and boxplots are used to understand the spread and skewness of features like pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
- **Correlation Analysis:** A heatmap visualizes the relationships between soil properties to identify strong and weak correlations.
- **Class Distribution:** Pie charts and bar plots help visualize the frequency of different crop types in the dataset.

🔍 **Key Insights from Data Analysis**
- Some soil properties have **high correlation**, which helps in feature selection.
- Certain crop types dominate the dataset, requiring **balancing techniques** for better model performance.
- Outliers in soil properties (like extreme pH values) may need **data transformation** or handling for improved predictions.
